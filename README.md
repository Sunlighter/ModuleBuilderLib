# ModuleBuilderLib
A helper for Reflection Emit. Reflection Emit already provides ``ModuleBuilder`` and classes like that; this library
provides complementary classes like ``ModuleToBuild``, allowing the declarative specification of what you want built.

This code has been separated out of the old code for Sunlit World Scheme. I thought it would be useful independently.
Sunlit World Scheme used to be licensed under the GPL2, but since I own the code, I am relicensing the
parts that appear here under the Apache 2.0 License.

Please be warned that the API is not stable yet. I am considering making breaking changes.
